# PYthonFIleORGANIZER

PYthonFIleORGANIZER (a.k.a pyfiorganizer), is a simple python script to unclutter my `~/Downloads` folder. 

Currently it creates `images`, `docs`, `audio`, `videos` and `misc` directories if they don't already exist. 

## TOOD 
- [ ] Read configuration file from user config directory to better move user files to directory of liking.
- [ ] Add more file types
- [ ] Create an indexer file which can be used to lookup where each file went for searchability.
